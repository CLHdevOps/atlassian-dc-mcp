     * - The current user has an e-mail address
     * - Pull requests cannot be rebased anonymously

     * - Note that in order to <i>view</i> a pull request a user is only required to have <i>read</i>      access to the {@link PullRequest#getToRef toRef}'s repository, so just because a user can <i>see</i>      a pull request does not mean they can request a rebase

                                     * For file and line comments, 'path' refers to the path of the file to which the comment should be applied and 'srcPath' refers to the path the that file used to have (only required for copies and moves). Also, fromHash and toHash refer to the sinceId / untilId (respectively) used to produce the diff on which the comment was added. Finally diffType refers to the type of diff the comment was added on. For backwards compatibility purposes if no diffType is provided and no fromHash/toHash pair is provided the diffType will be resolved to 'EFFECTIVE'. In any other cases the diffType is REQUIRED.

                                     * For line comments, 'line' refers to the line in the diff that the comment should apply to. 'lineType' refers to the type of diff hunk, which can be:
                                     *
                                     * - 'ADDED' - for an added line;
                                     * - 'REMOVED' - for a removed line; or
                                     * - 'CONTEXT' - for a line that was unmodified but is in the vicinity of the diff.
                                     *
                                     *
                                     * 'fileType' refers to the file of the diff to which the anchor should be attached - which is of relevance when displaying the diff in a side-by-side way. Currently the supported values are:
                                     *
                                     * - 'FROM' - the source file of the diff
                                     * - 'TO' - the destination file of the diff
                                     *
                                     *

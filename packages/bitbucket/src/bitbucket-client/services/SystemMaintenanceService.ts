    /**
     * Start export job
     * Starts a background job that exports the selected repositories.
     *
     * Only 2 concurrent exports are supported _per cluster node_. If a request ends up on a node that is already running that many export jobs, the request will be rejected and an error returned.
     *
     * The response includes a description of the job that has been started, and its ID can be used to query these details again, including the current progress, warnings and errors that occurred while processing the job, and to interrupt and cancel the execution of this job.
     *
     * The request to start an export is similar to the one for previewing an export. Additionally, it accepts an optional parameter, `exportLocation`, which can be used to specify a _relative_ path within `data/migration/export` in the shared home directory. No locations outside of that directory will be accepted for exports.
     *
     * There are essentially three ways to select repositories for export. Regardless of which you use, a few general rules apply:
     *
     * - You can supply a list of selectors. The selection will be additive.
     * - Repositories that are selected more than once due to overlapping selectors will be de-duplicated and effectively exported only once.
     * - For every selected repository, its full fork hierarchy will be considered selected, even if parts of that hierarchy would otherwise not be matched by the provided selectors. For example, when you explicitly select a single repository only, but that repository is a fork, then its origin will be exported (and eventually imported), too.
     *
     * Now, a single repository can be selected like this:
     *
     * ```
     *
     *
     *
     * {
         * "projectKey": "PRJ",
         * "slug": "my-repo"
         * }
         *
         * ```
         *
         * Second, all repositories in a specific project can be selected like this:
         *
         * ```
         *
         *
         *
         * {
             * "projectKey": "PRJ",
             * "slug": *"
             * }
             *
             * ```
             *
             * And third, all projects and repositories in the system would be selected like this:
             *
             * ```
             *
             *
             *
             * {
                 * "projectKey": "*",
                 * "slug": *"
                 * }
                 *

                 * The request to start a migration is similar to the one for previewing a migration.
                 *
                 * There are essentially three ways to select repositories for migration. Regardless of which you use, a few general rules apply:
                 *
                 * - You can supply a list of repository IDs and project IDs. The selection will be additive. All repositories     in the system are migrated if both lists are empty.     - Repositories that are selected more than once due to overlapping IDs will be de-duplicated and     effectively migrated only once.     - For every selected repository, its full fork hierarchy will be considered selected, even if parts of that     hierarchy would otherwise not be matched by the provided IDs. For example, when you explicitly     select a single repository only, but that repository is a fork, then its origin will be migrated too.
                 *
                 * Now, a single repository can be selected like this:
                 *
                 * ```
                 *
                 * {
                     * "repositoryIds": [1]
                     * }
                     * ```
                     *
                     * Multiple repositories can be selected like this:
                     *
                     *
                     *
                     * ```
                     *
                     * {
                         * "repositoryIds": [1, 2]
                         * }
                         * ```
                         *
                         * Second, all repositories in a specific project can be selected like this:
                         *
                         *
                         *
                         * ```
                         *
                         * {
                             * "projectIds": [1]
                             * }
                             * ```
                             *
                             * And third, all projects and repositories in the system would be selected like this:
                             *
                             *

                                 * the root permission filter name, e.g. <code>permission</code>, <code>permission.1</code> etc.) depending on the
                                 * permission resource. The system determines which filter to apply (Global, Project or Repository permission)
                                 * based on the `[root]` permission value. E.g. <code>ADMIN</code> is a global permission,
                                 * <code>PROJECT_ADMIN</code> is a project permission and <code>REPO_ADMIN</code> is a repository permission. Note
                                 * that the parameters for a given resource will be looked up in the order as they are listed below, that is e.g.
                                 * for a project resource, if both <code>projectId</code> and <code>projectKey</code> are provided, the system will
                                 * use <code>projectId</code> for the lookup.

                                 * The permission value under <code>[root]</code> is the only required and recognized parameter, as global
                                 * permissions do not apply to a specific resource.

                                 *
                                 * - <code>[root]</code>- specifies the project permission
                                 * - <code>[root].projectId</code> - specifies the project ID to lookup the project by
                                 * - <code>[root].projectKey</code> - specifies the project key to lookup the project by

                                 * @param filter Return only users, whose username, name or email address <i>contain</i> the <code> filter</code> value
                                 * @param permissionN The "root" of a single permission filter, similar to the <code>permission</code> parameter, where "N" is a natural number starting from 1. This allows clients to specify multiple permission filters, by providing consecutive filters as <code>permission.1</code>, <code>permission.2</code> etc. Note that the filters numbering has to start with 1 and be continuous for all filters to be processed. The total allowed number of permission filters is 50 and all filters exceeding that limit will be dropped. See the section "Permission Filters" above for more details on how the permission filters are processed.
                                 * @param permission The "root" of a permission filter, whose value must be a valid global, project, or repository permission. Additional filter parameters referring to this filter that specify the resource (project or repository) to apply the filter to must be prefixed with <code>permission.</code>. See the section "Permission Filters" above for more details.

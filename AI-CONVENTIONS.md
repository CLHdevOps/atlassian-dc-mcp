# Rules to follow for generated code

- Avoid duplication, especially in one file, extract common code into a function or a class.
- Prefer small composable classes or functions.
- Classes must be up to 300 lines of code. Functions up to 35 lines of code.
- Avoid generic comments, but explain non-obvious solutions in code.
